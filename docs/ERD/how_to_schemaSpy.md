# how to SchemaSpy

## Background

SchemaSpy is a tool for creating documentation for relational databases.
It is a Java-based tool (requires Java 8 or higher) that analyzes the metadata of a schema in
a database and generates a visual representation in a browser-displayable format.
It lets you click through the hierarchy of database tables via child and parent table
relationships as represented by both HTML links and entity-relationship diagrams.

The original project was hosted by
sourceforge ([http://schemaspy.sourceforge.net](http://schemaspy.sourceforge.net)), and is at
version 5. These notes apply to version 5.

As of summer 2018, the most recent verision is V6, ([http://schemaspy.org/](http://schemaspy.org/).
I have not tried it yet, but I'm sure it's better; let me know. Also see

## Mac instructions

V 5:

### Set up

1. Make sure you have homebrew:

```Shell
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

2. install graphviz (needed for the diagrams, which are dot and png)

``` Shell
brew install graphviz
```

3. Get schemaSpy (v 5 from sourceforge)
    1. schemaSpy_5.0.0.jar

4. Get Java connectors for databases. I have these
    1. postgresql-9.3-1103.jdbc3.jar
    1. mysql-connector-java-5.1.45-bin.jar

### Run

Example. I admit to throwing it all into the working dir, then moving output around later.

```Shell
java -jar schemaSpy_5.0.0.jar -t pgsql -db bon_data_pkgs -host rdb2 -u read_only_user -p password -o ./bon_data_pkgs/mb2eml_r/ -dp postgresql-9.3-1103.jdbc3.jar -s mb2eml_r -noads -renderer :quartz
```

Options:

|  |  |  | note|
|--|--|--|--|
| -t | type  |  |
| -db | db name | bon_data_pkgs |  
| -host | hostname | rdb2  |  This is my host, you'll have your own of course |
| -u | username |  |  
| -p | pw | |  
| -o | output directory|  |  
| -dp | path to driver | ./postgresql-9.3-1103.jdbc3.jar |
\ -s | schema | mb2eml_r | schemaSpy runs on one schema at a time. the LTER core MB database is expected to have 3 |
| -noads |  | | maybe no adverts? 
| -renderer | | :quartz |  needed to create dot files with graphviz. not sure why.

## Windows instructions

1. Install Java 8.
1. Install Graphviz from http://www.graphviz.org/download/.
1. Add the folder containing Graphvizâ€™s dot.exe application to your system PATH variable.
1. Browse to http://schemaspy.org/.
1. Click the download icon. Note that there isn't text that says "Download".  You have to click the icon. It's on the main hero banner.
1. Download Postgres Java driver from https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html.
1. Open a command window and enter the following to create documentation for the mb2eml_r schema in the bon_data_pkgs database. This assumes SchemaSpy and Graphviz JAR files are in the current folder in the command window.

```Shell
java -jar schemaspy_6.0.0.jar -t pgsql -db bon_data_pkgs -host rdb2 -u read_only_user -p password -o ./bon_data_pkgs/mb2eml_r/ -dp postgresql-42.2.5.jar -s mb2eml_r
```
